Plays the pen and paper game of Virus Wars! 
Rules:
Each cell in a square grid contains an X or an O, representing each player's virus colony, or an empty space. Initially, colony O is placed in 
the bottom left corner, and colony X is placed in the top right corner. For example, the starting configuration on a 3x3 grid, where E represents 
empty spaces.

     E E X
     E E E
     O E E

To start, the O colony will move first and will be given one move to balance out the advantage
of starting, then each player will take turns in making three moves in a row.
A move can either be the creation of a new virus, by moving to an accessible cell or
killing an opponent's virus, by shading over an opponent's symbol in an accessible cell.

A cell is accessible if it is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal to a player's existing live virus
or if it is connected to one of their live viruses through a chain of the opponent's killed viruses.

The first player that is unable to complete all 3 moves of their turn loses.
